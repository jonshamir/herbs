Chervil, also known as "Kerbel" or "Raviv," is a delicate herb that resembles parsley, belonging to the same family. Originally from the Caucasus region, it now grows widely in Europe. In Israel, a different but related species, Anthriscus lamprocarpus, is commonly found.

## In the Kitchen

Chervil has a subtle taste similar to parsley with a hint of anise. The plant is delicate, and it is generally preferable to use it fresh, although dried chervil can also be used.

It is particularly popular in French cuisine as part of the fines herbes blend, used to season chicken, seafood, young vegetables, soups, and sauces.

## Growing

Chervil prefers shade and cool temperatures but is sensitive to frost. It is challenging to grow in the Israeli heat, thriving only in a cool and well-shaded corner. Ideally, it should be cultivated in moist soil, kept away from direct sunlight.

## Herb Blends

Chervil is a key component of "Fines Herbes," an important herb blend in French cuisine:

[Parsley](parsley "HerbIcon") [Chives](chives "HerbIcon") [Chervil](chervil "HerbIcon") [Tarragon](tarragon "HerbIcon")

The blend is commonly used with fresh herbs or after a brief cooking period to delicately season dishes. It is frequently used in combination with chicken, seafood, young vegetables, and eggs.
