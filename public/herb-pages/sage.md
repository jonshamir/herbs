Sage is one of the oldest and most common herb plants. There are around 700 different species of sage, with 24 of them growing in Israel. While the medicinal sage commonly used in European cuisine doesn't grow in the country, the local variant, known as common sage, has a similar taste.

## In the Kitchen

You can use fresh or dried leaves, but it's important to separate the leaves from the stems, which can be tough and fibrous. Sage can be added at any stage of cooking as its flavor is robust.

You can make a fragrant sage tea by steeping the leaves in hot water.

In Italy, it is common to saut√© sage in butter and add it to dishes like pasta, risotto, gnocchi, and potatoes.

## History

Throughout most of history, humans have used sage for ceremonial and medicinal purposes. The Latin origin of its name, Salvia, is derived from the word for health. The use of sage as a culinary herb likely began in the 16th century in Europe.
