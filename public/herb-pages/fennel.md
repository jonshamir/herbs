Fennel is a perennial plant with a pronounced anise aroma. It has a subterranean bulb, which is also edible, and each winter it produces stalks that can reach a height of a meter or more.

## In the Kitchen

All parts of the plant are edible. The leaves are used as a herb, the "bulb" at the base of the plant serves as a vegetable, and the dried seeds are a significant spice - one of the components in the Chinese "Five Spice" blend.

The fibrous and tougher stalks are less commonly consumed. The leaves can be used in salads or as a garnish. The bulb can be sliced thinly and added to salads, cooked, or roasted in the oven.

In Syria and Lebanon, a dish called "Aje" is prepared with fennel leaves.

Fennel is also one of the plants used in making the famous Absinthe drink, along with anise and [grand-wormwood](grand-wormwood).
