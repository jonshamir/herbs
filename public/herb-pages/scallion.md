Green onion refers to the green leaves of one of the many varieties of onion plants found worldwide. Most commonly, varieties with a milder taste are used, as it is customary to eat it fresh.

## In the Kitchen

The upper part, the green leaves, has a milder taste than regular onions, making it suitable for use when fresh.

The "white" part at the base of the leaves is the bulb of the plant, a small onion with a delicate taste that can be used similarly to regular onions in cooking.
