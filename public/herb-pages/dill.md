## Dill

Dill, also known as "Shamir" or "Shavit," is a common herb with delicate feathery leaves.

### In the Kitchen

Dill can be used dried, but fresh leaves have a more distinct flavor. Generally, dill is sensitive to heat, so it's preferable to add it after cooking or towards the end.

Dill seeds, when dried, are also used as a spice, but they have a different taste.

In Eastern European kitchens, dill is popular and commonly added to fish, eggs, potatoes, dressings, salads, and soups.

A cucumber pickled with dill is called a "Kosher Dill pickle" in the United States and is considered a symbol of Jewish cuisine in the country. Besides being used as a herb and live spice, dried dill seeds can also be used as a spice.

### History

The plant likely received its Hebrew name by mistake. In the book of Isaiah, the expression "shamir v'shayit" appears, referring to thorny vegetation. The sages began using the name when referring to the herb.
