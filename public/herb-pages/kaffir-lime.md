Kaffir lime leaves are the leaves of the tropical tree also known as "Kaffir Lime." The leaves and the grated fruit have a strong lemony scent and a unique "double leaf" shape.

## In the Kitchen

Common in Southeast Asian cuisine, Kaffir lime leaves are an essential flavor component in dishes such as Thai Tom Yum soup, Cambodian Kroeung paste, various Vietnamese chicken dishes, and more.

Fresh, dried, or frozen leaves can be used in cooking.

## History

The origin of the word may be from the term "kafir," but it's unclear how it came to represent this particular fruit tree. In South Africa, the term "kaffir" is considered a derogatory term for a black person, so the preferred name is "Kaffir Lime," as it is known in Southeast Asia.
