# Lemongrass

Lemongrass is a type of herb that can reach a height of up to one and a half meters. It grows in warm tropical regions and is particularly prevalent in Southeast Asian cuisine - Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, etc.

## In the Kitchen

The majority of the lemony fragrance is concentrated in the white base of the plant, made up of layers of leaves, similar in structure to an onion.

Dried lemongrass can be used, but it is less potent. It is recommended to crush or bruise the plant before use to release the lemony fragrance. The plant is fibrous, so it is important to finely chop or crush it well before cooking. Large pieces of lemongrass can also be used in seasonings, similar to dill, which should be removed before eating. Trim the bottom part of the stalk and remove the outer leaves. The white part is aromatic but fibrous.

The leaves themselves can be used to make tea - in Israel, it is common to combine them with [lemon verbena](lemon-verbena).

The strong flavor and stable texture allow for long cooking.
