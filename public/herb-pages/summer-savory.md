Summer Savory is an aromatic herb used mainly in European seasoning. Originating in Europe, it is an annual herb that lives for one season, unlike its perennial family member, Winter Savory.

In Israel, Winter Savory, known in Arabic as "Za'atar Rumi," is more common and can be used interchangeably in Za'atar blends.

## In the Kitchen

Summer Savory has a taste reminiscent of thyme and marjoram, containing similar essential oils. It has a milder flavor compared to Winter Savory, with a hint of mintiness. It is particularly popular in traditional Acadian dishes in Canada during the holiday season.

In Mediterranean seafood cuisine, Summer Savory is often used with beans and other small legumes, believed by some to counteract gas that such foods may cause. In Italy, it is used to season meat dishes.

In Persian, the herb is called "Marzeh" and is used for rice seasoning.
