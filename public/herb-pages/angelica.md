## History

There is evidence of the use of angelica as a food and medicinal plant since the 10th century, mainly in the area of its natural distribution in Northern Europe and Scandinavia. The plant has special importance in Sami culture, the people who live in Lapland in northern Scandinavia. Sami people make a flute called Fadno from the hollow stalks of the plant.

In the late Middle Ages, the plant was used as a remedy for the Black Death. It is said that a monk saw an angel in his dream, who instructed him to use the plant as a remedy for the plague - and from there also comes the name of the plant angelica. The medicine was probably not particularly effective and the plague was the deadliest in history.

Angelica is a versatile herb with a long history of use. It has a distinctive aroma and flavor that makes it a popular ingredient in many dishes.
