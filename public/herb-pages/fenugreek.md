Fenugreek is a spice with a strong aroma, belonging to the legume family.

## In the Kitchen

Generally, the use of the plant's dried seeds is more common, but the leaves also have the same characteristic flavor. They can be used either dried or fresh.

Fenugreek is particularly associated with Yemeni, Indian, and Persian cuisines:

Yemenites prepare dips and even identify the plant as "Rubia," mentioned in the Talmud and eaten on the New Year.

In Persian cuisine, the plant's leaves are used in dishes such as Ghormeh Sabzi. The plant is known by the name "Shanbalileh" (شنبلیله) or sometimes "Shambalileh."

The plant is also widespread in Indian cuisine, known as "Methi." The dried leaves are known as Kasuri Methi, named after the city of Kasur in present-day Pakistan.

Surprisingly, fenugreek seeds are used to create a cheap alternative to maple syrup, as it can produce a liquid with a similar scent to the expensive maple syrup.
