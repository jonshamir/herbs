Tarragon is a herb with a mild anise-like fragrance, commonly used in French cuisine.

## In the Kitchen

It is one of the four herbs that make up the French blend Fines Herbes, and it is widely used in French cooking in general. When cooking with tarragon, it is advisable to add it towards the end to preserve its flavor.

Tarragon can be purchased dried, but much of its fragrance is lost, so it's preferable to use the fresh herb.

There are two main varieties - French and Russian. The French variety is considered more flavorful, despite the Russian type being more robust and growing taller.

## History

The name of the herb comes from its root structure, which medieval Europeans thought resembled a snake or a coiled dragon. They also believed in its ability to repel dragons. Originally, it likely comes from Western Asia or South Russia, and it only began to be used in European cooking in the Middle Ages.
