Oregano, perhaps the most well-known in its genus, is extensively used in Mediterranean cuisine, especially in Italy and Greece. It has a taste and aroma similar to [marjoram](marjoram), but stronger.

## In the Kitchen

Oregano leaves are very popular in Mediterranean kitchens, particularly in Italian and Greek cuisine. It is commonly used in its dried form, preserving its aroma over time. Dried oregano releases flavors over long cooking periods, making it a common addition to tomato sauces and slow-cooked meat dishes.

In the Americas, a plant with a similar taste, known as "Mexican oregano," is often used, although it is not closely related.

## History

Oregano's origin lies in the Mediterranean region, likely in the hills of Greece. Ancient Greeks began using it as both a medicinal herb and a spice. The name originates from Greek, meaning "joy of the mountain" - ὄρος (mountain), γάνος (joy, brightness, happiness).

## Herb Blends

Oregano is commonly found in the _Herbes de Provence_, a blend of Mediterranean herbs typical of the Provence region in France:

[Marjoram](marjoram "HerbIcon") [Rosemary](rosemary "HerbIcon") [Thyme](thyme "HerbIcon") [Oregano](oregano "HerbIcon") [Summer Savory](summer-savory "HerbIcon")

The blend is usually sold dried, and its components are well-preserved, suitable for cooking in heat, in grilled dishes, or stews. Lavender is sometimes added to the blend.
