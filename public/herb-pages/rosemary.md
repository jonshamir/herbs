Rosemary has thin and elongated leaves, and is widespread in Mediterranean countries. Botanically, rosemary is considered a type of mint, but in culinary terms and in taste, it is very different.

## In the Kitchen

It can be used either dried or fresh, in long cooking or in the oven. Unlike milder herbs, rosemary does not easily lose its flavor.

It has a distinctive aroma somewhat close to the scent of [lavender](lavender), and they can be used in a similar manner in many cases.

The leaves can be fibrous, so it's advisable to chop them finely, cook for a long time, or remove before consumption. When roasted in the oven, the leaves char slightly, adding a smoky flavor to the dish.

## History

The Greeks believed that rosemary enhances memory, and there is evidence that they used it in cooking back then.

The origin of the name is Latin, meaning "sea dew," possibly because it grew near the Mediterranean Sea, and perhaps because its flowers are blue (like the sea).

## Spice Blends

The plant is often part of "Herbes de Provence," a Mediterranean herb blend considered characteristic of the Provence region in France:

[Marjoram](marjoram "HerbIcon") [Rosemary](rosemary "HerbIcon") [Thyme](thyme "HerbIcon") [Oregano](oregano "HerbIcon") [Summer Savory](summer-savory "HerbIcon")

The blend is usually sold dried, and its components are well-preserved, suitable for cooking with heat, in grilled dishes, or stews. Sometimes, [lavender](lavender) is also added to the blend.
