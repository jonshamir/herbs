Rosemary, with its thin and elongated leaves, is prevalent in Mediterranean countries. While botanically considered a type of mint, in culinary terms and taste, it is notably different.

## In the Kitchen

Rosemary can be utilized in both dried and fresh forms, suitable for long cooking or oven roasting. Unlike milder herbs, rosemary retains its flavor well.

It possesses a distinct aroma somewhat reminiscent of [lavender](lavender), and they can be used interchangeably in many cases.

The leaves may be fibrous, so finely chopping them, prolonged cooking, or removing before consumption is recommended. When roasted in the oven, the leaves char slightly, imparting a smoky flavor to the dish.

## History

Ancient Greeks believed that rosemary could enhance memory, and historical evidence suggests its use in their cuisine.

The name has Latin origins, meaning "sea dew," possibly due to its growth near the Mediterranean Sea or the blue color of its flowers.

## Spice Blends

Rosemary is a key component of "Herbes de Provence," a Mediterranean herb blend typical of the Provence region in France:

[Marjoram](marjoram "HerbIcon") [Rosemary](rosemary "HerbIcon") [Thyme](thyme "HerbIcon") [Oregano](oregano "HerbIcon") [Summer Savory](summer-savory "HerbIcon")

This blend is commonly sold in a dried form, with well-preserved components suitable for various cooking methods, such as grilling or stewing. Occasionally, [lavender](lavender) is included in the blend.
