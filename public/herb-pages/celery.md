Celery, also known as celeriac or celery root, is a vegetable and spice. The plant's thick and long stalks are used in various dishes, and its leaves can be used for seasoning similarly to parsley. The dried seeds are also an important spice in many kitchens.

## In the Kitchen

The plant is primarily known for its thick and long stalks. The stalks are fibrous and crisp when used fresh, in salads, and more. The fresh leaves can be used as a seasoning with a slightly peppery taste, somewhat similar to black pepper. They can be mixed into salads or used to garnish dishes, similar to parsley.

When cooking, it's important to note that the stalks are particularly fibrous, as are the leaves to some extent. They should be cooked for a long time or cut into small, vertically sliced pieces to achieve a smooth texture.

Celery is included in the Passover Seder plate, and it is customary to dip it during the Seder ritual - in saltwater, vinegar, or even in charoset.

Celery, along with carrots and onions, forms the base for many European dishes. The vegetables are diced into small cubes and simmered for an extended period over low heat until they break down. In France, this mixture is called "mirepoix," while similar mixtures in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese cuisines are known as "sofrito."

In the United States, it is common to eat fresh celery stalks with peanut butter as a healthy snack.
