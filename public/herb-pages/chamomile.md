## History

Chamomile has different names in various languages, but most of them are somehow related to apples. "Chamomile" comes from the Greek name "khamaimelon," meaning ground apple. The Hebrew name "Babonog" is derived from the Persian word "babundish," which means ground apple. The Spanish name "manzanilla" translates to small apple, and similarly in other languages.
