The basil is a spice plant with shiny and delicate leaves, originating in tropical regions of Africa and Asia. There is a wide variety of basil types, ranging in color from green to purple, and their flavors vary from anise-like to lemony. There are three types that stand out in particular - Sweet Basil, Thai Basil, and Holy Basil (Tulsi).

## Sweet Basil

The most well-known in the Western world, commonly used in Italian cuisine, especially in combination with cheeses like mozzarella or ricotta. It is often not used with meat in Italian recipes. One of its common uses is in the famous pesto sauce, where basil leaves are crushed with Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and garlic.

## Thai Basil

Popular in the kitchens of Southeast Asia, it has a more anise-like aroma compared to other basil varieties but is more refined than Holy Basil.

In Southeast Asian cuisine, it is common to use a large quantity of fresh leaves in dishes.

## Holy Basil (Tulsi)

Tulsi is spicier than other basil species. It originates from India, where it is considered holy. Due to its sacred status, it is not commonly cooked but is often steeped for a few minutes to create a fragrant beverage.
