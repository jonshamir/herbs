Also known as Azubion, Lavender is an important aromatic plant with fragrant characteristics in all its parts. Various Lavender species grow wild in different regions. It is also cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its pleasant flowers.

## In the Kitchen

Both the leaves and flowers are used in cooking and baking, especially in desserts. Lavender can be used to make tea.

The fragrance can be potent, particularly in dried flower buds, so it is recommended to use a small amount. In large quantities, it can impart a bitter and "soapy" taste to dishes.

## Spice Blends

Lavender is sometimes part of the "Herbes de Provence," a Mediterranean spice blend considered typical of the Provence region in France:

- [Marjoram](marjoram "HerbIcon")
- [Rosemary](rosemary "HerbIcon")
- [Thyme](thyme "HerbIcon")
- [Oregano](oregano "HerbIcon")
- [Summer Savory](summer-savory "HerbIcon")

The blend is usually sold dried, and its components are well-preserved, suitable for cooking in high-temperature dishes, grilled foods, or stews.
