Arugula, also known as rocket or roquette, is a leafy green with a peppery taste reminiscent of mustard. It is often used for its fresh leaves, as they lose much of their flavor when cooked and tend to wilt.

## In the Kitchen

Fresh arugula leaves are popular in salads and sandwiches, pairing well with tangy dressings.

In Italy, it is common to place fresh arugula on pizza just as it comes out of the oven, providing a contrast in texture and flavor to the rich dish. Additionally, arugula is used to make pasta sauces.

Young arugula leaves are tender and have a relatively mild taste compared to mature leaves.

In some cuisines, arugula is also used as a substitute for watercress.
