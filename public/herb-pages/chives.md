One of the small plants from the onion family, chives, has long and delicate leaves and imparts a mild garlic flavor to dishes. There is no relation between this plant and the wild chives known as "irit," but it likely got its name due to the similarity in leaf shape.

## In the Kitchen

Chives have a milder aroma than garlic and onions. This herb is common worldwide, often used fresh in salads and garnishes or as a topping for baked potatoes.

When cooked or baked, chives quickly lose their flavor.

Chive blossoms and flowers are also edible and used for garnishing dishes and salads.

In certain varieties of chives, particularly in Chinese cuisine, they are widely used as a decorative element for fried, stir-fried, or mixed dishes, adding long strips after cooking for color and a subtle flavor.

## Herb Blends

Chives are included in "Fines Herbes," an important herb blend in French cuisine:

[Parsley](parsley "HerbIcon") [Chives](chives "HerbIcon") [Chervil](chervil "HerbIcon") [Tarragon](tarragon "HerbIcon")

The blend is commonly used with fresh herbs or after a brief cooking period to delicately season dishes. It is frequently used in combination with chicken, seafood, young vegetables, and eggs.
