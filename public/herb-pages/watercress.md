Watercress, with its characteristic mustard spiciness, belongs to the cruciferous family. The plant grows near water sources, such as springs and streams, hence its name.

## In the Kitchen

The leaves or fresh shoots of watercress are consumed raw in salads and sandwiches. The more mature leaves can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable or used as a filling for pastry, similar to cress.

Watercress has a taste and culinary use similar to its relative, [garden cress](garden-cress).

After the plant flowers, the leaves become more bitter and are less recommended for consumption.
