Fennel grows wild in Israel and in parts of the Mediterranean. The leaves have a bitter taste and a distinctive aroma.

## In the Kitchen

When cooking with fennel, it is important to remove it after a short time as it is bitter and has a very strong taste. You can boil the leaves for a minute or two in hot water, discard them, and use the water for seasoning. The essential oils are released into the water before the bitter taste.

It pairs well with acidic ingredients such as tomatoes, olives, and capers.

You can add a little to salads or pickled vegetables.

In Ethiopia, the plant is called "Tendam," and it is customary to infuse it in coffee for a delicate fragrance. Ethiopians also use it to season cheeses and dairy products. Fennel fruits are an ingredient in some versions of the Ethiopian spice blend called "Berbere."

## History

In ancient Rome and the Middle Ages, fennel was more common as a spice, but today it is mainly used in Ethiopian cuisine.

Fennel is associated with beliefs related to demons and exorcism, as researchers and linguists have concluded from its names in different languages: in Arabic, the plant is called "Fijen," meaning "demon"; Yemeni Jews call it "Shed'av," meaning "demon's egg"; and in Morocco, it is called "Ruta" (or "Roda"), the name of a mythological demon. Sometimes fennel is mentioned for its supposed properties to ward off the evil eye and various diseases.
