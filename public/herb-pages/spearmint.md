Spearmint is one of the important herbs, known for its refreshing and unique scent.

## In the Kitchen

Spearmint, also known as "karkat," is the more common species used in Israel. Unlike peppermint, it produces a lower and less noticeable amount of menthol, creating a cool sensation when in contact with the mouth.

Fresh leaves are useful in various dishes, from cooked meals to fresh salads and desserts. Spearmint leaves can be steeped in hot water for a refreshing tea, blended into shakes, or used as a seasoning or garnish for different dishes.

It is prevalent in Middle Eastern cuisines, such as Persian, Lebanese, Palestinian, and more. In British cuisine, mint is also used to season lamb dishes and as a filling for chocolate.
