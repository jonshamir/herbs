Summer Savory is an important herb that grows in the Mediterranean region. It is a low plant with small and delicate leaves but has a distinctive aroma. In Israel, it is closely related to the Coridothymus capitatus, known as "Za'atar Parsi."

## In the Kitchen

Genetically and culinarily close to oregano, it shares its taste with [za'atar](zaatar) and [thyme](thyme). Dried savory can be used while preserving its flavor, as it is heat-resistant and suitable for long cooking.

You can remove all the leaves from the woody stem by pinching and pulling or alternatively use the stems as they are and remove them before eating. Suitable for meat dishes, cream, potatoes, mushrooms, soups, stews, and more.

## Spice Blends

Summer Savory is often part of Herbes de Provence, a Mediterranean herb blend typical of the Provence region in France:

[Marjoram](marjoram "HerbIcon") [Rosemary](rosemary "HerbIcon") [Thyme](thyme "HerbIcon") [Oregano](oregano "HerbIcon") [Summer Savory](summer-savory "HerbIcon")

The blend is usually sold dried, and its components preserve well, making it suitable for cooking in heat, grilled dishes, or stews. Lavender is sometimes added to the blend.
