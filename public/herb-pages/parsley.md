Parsley is an important and iconic herb that likely needs no introduction. Originating from Southern Europe, it doesn't grow wild but can be relatively easily cultivated in local climates.

## In the Kitchen

Parsley is highly popular in European kitchens and is common in most parts of the world. Fresh leaves can be used in salads and as garnish for dishes. The leaves are relatively resistant to cooking, so they can be added throughout the cooking process.

## History

In ancient Greece, this plant symbolized death, and it was scattered above graves. The Romans started using it in cooking and would chew parsley at the end of meals to freshen their breath.

## Herb Blends

Parsley is part of _Fines Herbes_, an important herb blend in French cuisine:

[Parsley](parsley "HerbIcon") [Chives](chives "HerbIcon") [Chervil](chervil "HerbIcon") [Tarragon](tarragon "HerbIcon")

The blend is commonly used with fresh herbs or after brief cooking to season delicate dishes. It's often used in combination with chicken, seafood, young vegetables, and eggs.
