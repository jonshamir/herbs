Curry leaves come from the sweet neem tree, which grows in India and Sri Lanka. They are a crucial ingredient in many Indian dishes and get their name from curry dishes.

### In the Kitchen

Curry leaves have a distinctive and slightly citrusy flavor.

Typically, the leaves are used in the initial stages of preparing a dish to create an aromatic base. In many cases, the process of making a curry dish begins with saut√©ing curry leaves along with mustard seeds and onions. The mixture is cooked over low heat for an extended period until the onions break down and become caramelized.

Despite their name, curry leaves are **not** a mandatory ingredient in curry blends or curry powders, and many curry dishes do not contain them at all.

It is preferable to use fresh leaves, but dried leaves also retain their flavor.
