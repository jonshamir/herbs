Winter savory, a fragrant herb, is used to season European dishes primarily. Originating in Europe, it is a perennial plant compared to its annual family member, [summer savory](summer-savory).

In Israel, winter savory, known in Arabic as "Za'atar Rumi," can be used in Za'atar mixtures instead of the common Za'atar herb.

## In the Kitchen

Winter savory's taste resembles thyme and summer savory, containing similar essential oils.

Winter savory, with a stronger flavor than the summer variety, is suitable for stews and long-cooking dishes that enhance its taste.

In Mediterranean cuisine, it is common to use winter savory with beans and other legumes. Some believe it counteracts the gas that such foods may cause. In Italy, it is used for seasoning meats.

In Persian cuisine, the plant is called "Marzeh" and is used for rice seasoning.

## Spice Blends

The plant is often part of the "Herbes de Provence," a Mediterranean spice blend typical of the Provence region in France:

[Marjoram](marjoram "HerbIcon") [Rosemary](rosemary "HerbIcon") [Thyme](thyme "HerbIcon") [Oregano](oregano "HerbIcon") [Winter Savory](summer-savory "HerbIcon")

The blend is usually sold dried, with its components well preserved and suitable for cooking with heat, in grilled dishes or stews. Lavender is sometimes added to the blend.
